# X2 Benchmark
This is a very simple PC benchmarking program based around the processor's ability to do math quickly. It measures how quickly it can multiply a number by 2 (hence the name "X2"). Version 1 is currently available, although it is not very good and uses a flawed testing methodology, so I'm currently working on version 2, which should be released soon enough... hopefully.

> Make sure that you have a windows PC, as this runs primarily on batch files. It hasn't been tested on anything below windows 10 but please feel free to try

How to Install:
1) Make a program folder where the program will be stored on your PC
2) Extract the release zip file into the folder
3) Start the .exe to begin benchmarking
Keep in mind that the program can also be installed as a portable program on a USB if you follow the steps above

# How to use the Benchmark
Run 2xBenchmark.exe, and simply click the benchmark icon. This will run the benchmark batch file, and will read the specifications of your system (v2 only).

Once the 30 calculation benchmark is complete, you will have a time result provided on your screen to show how quickly your pc has completed the benchmark.
The time is listed in hh:mm:ss.ms order

# Scoring
The scoring system is pretty easy to understand.
The benchmarks are scored by the time that it takes your computer to execute the benchmark.
A higher time, means a slower computer, which is bad.
A lower time means a faster computer, which is good.

# Branches and Releases
As you'll soon notice, there are several branches and releases for this repo.
Any releases are stable, and should work fine. Please feel free to let me know if anything goes wrong, and I'll fix it in the next release.
The branches that are marked as STABLE are the source code for the releases, and usually contain the release .zip file somewhere in it. The Work In Progress branch however, is the unstable pre-release testing environment that I use as a base to code the newer versions, eventually once this branch becomes stable, it will become its own STABLE branch and Release.
